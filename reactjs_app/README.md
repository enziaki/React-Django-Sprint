# Reactjs Assessment

#### Project Brief: React-powered Post Viewer

**Objective:** Develop a single-page React application that retrieves and displays a list of posts from the JSON Placeholder API: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).

**Key Features:**

* **Data Fetching:** Implement functionality to acquire post data from the specified API endpoint dynamically.
* **Post Display:** Design a UI component to effectively present the retrieved list of posts in a user-friendly manner.
* **Content Toggling:** Integrate a mechanism (button or link) allowing users to switch between viewing full post content and condensed summaries.
* **React Expertise:** Utilize core React concepts like state management, components, lifecycle methods, and functional components with hooks for optimal code structure and efficiency.

**Timeline:** 4-5 days

**Additional Notes:**

* Feel free to leverage any additional libraries or tools deemed beneficial for efficient development.
* Emphasis on implementing modern React practices like functional components and hooks is encouraged.
* A clear understanding of component lifecycles, state management techniques, and handling asynchronous operations is expected.
