# Reactjs and Django Assessment

## Build a Task Manager Web App in 1-1.5 Weeks!

Craft a full-stack web application with Django (backend) and React (frontend) to manage tasks.

**Backend (Django):**

1. Create models for tasks (title, description, completed, etc.).
2. Build REST API endpoints using Django REST Framework:
    * Fetch all tasks.
    * Create new tasks.
    * Update tasks (mark completed).

**Frontend (React):**

1. Set up React app with Create React App.
2. Display retrieved tasks.
3. Create new tasks through a form.
4. Mark tasks complete with a toggle button.

**Integration:**

1. Connect React to Django API.
2. Ensure frontend updates reflect in backend.
3. Show loading states and handle errors gracefully.

**Timeline:** 1-1.5 weeks.

**Bonus:**

* Use Django REST Framework for API development.
* Understand data flow between frontend and backend.
* Master asynchronous operations (API calls, state updates).
