## Reactjs and Django Assessment

#### Build a Task Manager Web App in 1-1.5 Weeks!

Craft a full-stack web application with Django (backend) and React (frontend) to manage tasks.

**Backend (Django):**

1. Create models for tasks (title, description, completed, etc.).
2. Build REST API endpoints using Django REST Framework:
    * Fetch all tasks.
    * Create new tasks.
    * Update tasks (mark completed).

**Frontend (React):**

1. Set up React app with Create React App.
2. Display retrieved tasks.
3. Create new tasks through a form.
4. Mark tasks complete with a toggle button.

**Integration:**

1. Connect React to Django API.
2. Ensure frontend updates reflect in backend.
3. Show loading states and handle errors gracefully.

**Timeline:** 1-1.5 weeks.

**Bonus:**

* Use Django REST Framework for API development.
* Understand data flow between frontend and backend.
* Master asynchronous operations (API calls, state updates).

## Reactjs Assessment

#### Project Brief: React-powered Post Viewer

**Objective:** Develop a single-page React application that retrieves and displays a list of posts from the JSON Placeholder API: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).

**Key Features:**

* **Data Fetching:** Implement functionality to acquire post data from the specified API endpoint dynamically.
* **Post Display:** Design a UI component to effectively present the retrieved list of posts in a user-friendly manner.
* **Content Toggling:** Integrate a mechanism (button or link) allowing users to switch between viewing full post content and condensed summaries.
* **React Expertise:** Utilize core React concepts like state management, components, lifecycle methods, and functional components with hooks for optimal code structure and efficiency.

**Timeline:** 4-5 days

**Additional Notes:**

* Feel free to leverage any additional libraries or tools deemed beneficial for efficient development.
* Emphasis on implementing modern React practices like functional components and hooks is encouraged.
* A clear understanding of component lifecycles, state management techniques, and handling asynchronous operations is expected.
